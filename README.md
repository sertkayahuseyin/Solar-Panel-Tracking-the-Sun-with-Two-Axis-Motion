# Solar-Panel-Tracking-the-Sun-with-Two-Axis-Motion
With this project, the maximum efficiency of the panel, whose panel will be positioned perpendicular to the sun, is provided by tracking the sun at all hours of the day with both its own axis and horizontal angle movement.  In this project, we aim to store the energy produced in batteries and to measure the energy produced with the current voltage sensor in real time.  In addition, by writing the information coming from the current voltage sensor to an SD card, it will be possible to access information such as day and hour efficiency.  Our project will work during the day to save energy and will reach the reference position with the sunset and wait for the next working hours to start.

Teensy 3.6, LDR's, button, SD card, RTC, INA226 sensor and servo motors were used in the project. Details are given in the document.

The software and algorithm flow diagrams that I used in the project are given in detail in the file content.

The project is written in Turkish. It will be arranged in English form as soon as possible.
